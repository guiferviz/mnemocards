# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.


## Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

* Report bugs using GitHub issues.

* Fix bugs listed in the GitHub issues page. Look for those marked with a
"Good first issue" if you are looking for something easy.

* Implement features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is
open to whoever wants to implement it.

* Write documentation. Update/add docstrings in the Python code, contribute to
any file inside the `docs` directory, or even create blog posts in your
favourite blogging platform.

* Submit feedback using GitHub issues. Issues are not necessarily for bugs, you
can use them to post any kind of ideas/feedback or just thank the authors for
their work :fontawesome-regular-handshake:.
