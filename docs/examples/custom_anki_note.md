# Custom Anki note

This example shows how to create a custom Anki card type. The data used is a
list of food additives, with their name, code and toxicity. The fields name,
code and toxicity are not present in vocabulary note types, so we need to
create a custom Anki note.

Additives XML table has been created using the table from the
[www.aditivos-alimentarios.com](https://www.aditivos-alimentarios.com) website
(Spanish).

No docs yet, but you can [explore the
code](https://github.com/guiferviz/mnemocards/tree/main/examples/custom_anki_note)
in the repo.
