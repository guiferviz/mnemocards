# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why use text files for flashcards instead of binary formats or manual creation in Anki?

Reading **flashcards from text files** has several **advantages** over binary
formats or manually creating cards in the Anki app. Text files are easily
readable and editable by humans. This means that users can easily understand
and modify the flashcard content **using common text editors**, and also can
use version control systems like **Git to track changes and collaborate** with
others.


## How can I create custom Mnemocards tasks?

The [plugins](examples/plugins.md) example contains a lot of information about
